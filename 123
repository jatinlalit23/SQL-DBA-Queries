/*

Explanation:
Variable Declarations:

@SourceDirectory: The directory where the original backup files are stored.
@DestinationDirectory: The directory where you want to copy and rename the backup file.
@FileName: Holds the name of the most recent .bak file found in the source directory.
@NewFileName: The new name you want to assign to the copied file in the destination directory.
Finding the Most Recent Backup File:

xp_cmdshell is used with the dir command to list all .bak files in the source directory, sorted by date (/o-d).
The most recent file is selected using TOP 1.
Copying and Renaming the Backup File:

The copy command is constructed to copy the most recent .bak file from the source directory to the destination directory, renaming it to LatestBackup.bak.
If no .bak files are found, a message is printed.
Execution:

The xp_cmdshell command executes the copy and rename operation.
Ensure that xp_cmdshell is enabled on your SQL Server instance, as it is disabled by default.
